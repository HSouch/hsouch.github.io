									<p> You found my quote repository! Here are a collection of quotes that mean
										a lot to me, for one reason or another. </p>

									<div class="box">
										"There is a time when the operation of the machine becomes so
										odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part! You can't even
										passively take part! And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon
										the wheels ... upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make
										it stop! And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who
										own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at
										all!"

										<p style="text-align: right"> - Mario Savio, 1964 </p>

									<div class="box">
										"Hark! Hark! Triton. Hark! Bellow, bid our father the sea king. Rise from the
										depths full foul in his fury. Black waves teeming with salt foam to smother
										this young mouth with pungent slime. To choke ye. Engorging your
										organs till ye turn blue and bloated with bilge and brine and can scream no
										more. Only when he, crowned in cockle shells, with slithering tentacle tail,
										and steaming beard take up his fell befinned arm, his coral tongued trident
										screeches banshee-like in the tempest, and plunges right through your
										gullet. Bursting ye. A bulging bladder no more, but a blasted bloody film
										now a nothing for the harpies and the souls of dead sailors to pick and claw
										and feed upon only to be lapped up and swallowed up by the infinite waters
										of the dread emperor himself. Forgotten to any man, to any time. Forgotten
										to any god or devil,
										forgotten even to the sea. For any stuff or part of Winslow, even any
										scantling of your soul is Winslow no more, but is now itself the sea."

										<p style="text-align: right"> - Daniel Defoe, <i> The Lighthouse</i>. (This is
										literally my Lorem Ipsum)</p>

											The path forward would seem obvious, if only I knew how many months or years I
											had left. Tell me three months, I’d just spend time with family. Tell me one year,
											I’d have a plan (write that book). Give me 10 years, I’d get back to treating diseases.
											The pedestrian truth that you live one day at a time didn’t help: What was I
											supposed to do with that day? My oncologist would say only: “I can’t tell you a
											time. You’ve got to find what matters most to you.”

											I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense,
											had changed both nothing and everything. Before my cancer was diagnosed, I knew
											that someday I would die, but I didn’t know when. After the diagnosis, I knew
											that someday I would die, but I didn’t know when. But now I knew it acutely.
											The problem wasn’t really a scientific one. The fact of death is unsettling.
											Yet there is no other way to live.
