										"There is a time when the operation of the machine becomes so
										odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part! You can't even
										passively take part! And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon
										the wheels ... upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make
										it stop! And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who
										own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at
										all!"

										<p style="text-align: right"> - Mario Savio, 1964 </p>

										"Hark! Hark! Triton. Hark! Bellow, bid our father the sea king. Rise from the
										depths full foul in his fury. Black waves teeming with salt foam to smother
										this young mouth with pungent slime. To choke ye. Engorging your
										organs till ye turn blue and bloated with bilge and brine and can scream no
										more. Only when he, crowned in cockle shells, with slithering tentacle tail,
										and steaming beard take up his fell befinned arm, his coral tongued trident
										screeches banshee-like in the tempest, and plunges right through your
										gullet. Bursting ye. A bulging bladder no more, but a blasted bloody film
										now a nothing for the harpies and the souls of dead sailors to pick and claw
										and feed upon only to be lapped up and swallowed up by the infinite waters
										of the dread emperor himself. Forgotten to any man, to any time. Forgotten
										to any god or devil,
										forgotten even to the sea. For any stuff or part of Winslow, even any
										scantling of your soul is Winslow no more, but is now itself the sea."

											The path forward would seem obvious, if only I knew how many months or years I
											had left. Tell me three months, I’d just spend time with family. Tell me one year,
											I’d have a plan (write that book). Give me 10 years, I’d get back to treating diseases.
											The pedestrian truth that you live one day at a time didn’t help: What was I
											supposed to do with that day? My oncologist would say only: “I can’t tell you a
											time. You’ve got to find what matters most to you.”

											I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense,
											had changed both nothing and everything. Before my cancer was diagnosed, I knew
											that someday I would die, but I didn’t know when. After the diagnosis, I knew
											that someday I would die, but I didn’t know when. But now I knew it acutely.
											The problem wasn’t really a scientific one. The fact of death is unsettling.
											Yet there is no other way to live.

											A legion of horribles, hundreds in number, half naked or clad in costumes
											attic or biblical or wardrobed out of a fevered dream with the skins of
											animals and silk finery and pieces of uniform still tracked with the blood
											of prior owners, coats of slain dragoons, frogged and braided cavalry
											jackets, one in a stovepipe hat and one with an umbrella and one in white
											stockings and a bloodstained wedding veil and some in headgear or
											cranefeathers or rawhide helmets that bore the horns of bull or buffalo
											and one in a pigeontailed coat worn backwards and otherwise naked and one
											in the armor of a Spanish conquistador, the breastplate and pauldrons
											deeply dented with old blows of mace or sabre done in another country by
											men whose very bones were dust and many with their braids spliced up with
											the hair of other beasts until they trailed upon the ground and their
											horses' ears and tails worked with bits of brightly colored cloth and
											one whose horse's whole head was painted crimson red and all the
											horsemen's faces gaudy and grotesque with daubings like a company of
											mounted clowns, death hilarious, all howling in a barbarous tongue and
											riding down upon them like a horde from a hell more horrible yet than
											the brimstone land of Christian reckoning, screeching and yammering and
											clothed in smoke like those vaporous beings in regions beyond right
											knowing where the eye wanders and the lip jerks and drools.

											The ground shuddered, and there was a sound like a door slamming, deep in
											the ground. Alarms went off, from cars and houses, distant wails. Maureen
											hurried back to the pergola. She sat with Caitlin, and they wrapped their
											arms around each other. Caitlin raised her wrist to peer at her watch,
											then gave it up. “I don’t suppose we need a countdown.”

											The ground shook more violently, and there was an odd sound, like waves
											rushing over pebbles on a beach. Maureen peered out of the pergola.
											Remarkably, one wall of her house had given way, just like that, and the
											bricks had tumbled into a heap.

											It is curious, but till that moment I had never realized what it means to
											destroy a healthy, conscious man. When I saw the prisoner step aside to
											avoid the puddle, I saw the mystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of cutting
											a life short when it is in full tide. This man was not dying, he was alive
											just as we were alive. All the organs of his body were working –bowels
											digesting food, skin renewing itself, nails growing, tissues forming–all
											toiling away in solemn foolery. His nails would still be growing when he
											stood on the drop, when he was falling through the air with a tenth of a
											second to live. His eyes saw the yellow gravel and the grey walls, and
											his brain still remembered, foresaw, reasoned – reasoned even about
											puddles. He and we were a party of men walking together, seeing, hearing,
											feeling, understanding the same world; and in two minutes, with a sudden
											snap, one of us would be gone – one mind less, one world less.
