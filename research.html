												<p> Galaxies traveling through a galaxy cluster will experience <i>ram pressure</i> as they pass through the intracluster medium. Being that a galaxy is made up of a multi-component medium (including stars, gas, dust, and dark matter), these different components will be affected differently. Stars feel effectively no pressure, but gaseous components, being more diffuse in nature, can be accelerated away from the galaxy disk. In strong cases, this manifests as a stripped gas tail behind a galaxy, which can sometimes be a site of star formation. The most extreme examples are often deemed "jellyfish galaxies". </p>

												<p> This process can be studied with a considerable number of different tracers, but molecular gas, traced by CO(2-1) emission, is my key focus. My data is from the ALMA-JELLY large program, which provides structural and kinematic information for galaxies experiencing extreme RPS. My focus is on galaxies in the Coma cluster, located over 200 million light years away. </p>

												<p>
													Ram pressure stripping is an effect on many different mass scales, including dwarf galaxies passing through the CGM of a host galaxy. By studying the most extreme examples of RPS, we can gain insight into the process on scales where observing and studying the effects are more challenging, especially in lower mass targets.

											<p> Surface Brightness Profiles </p>

											<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
												<p> Surface brightness profiles quantify the light of a galaxy as a function of
													distance from its center. It has a vast multitide of uses, and a significant amount
													of information about a galaxy's properties and overall structure can be gleaned from
													even a simple 1-dimensional profile. </p>

												<p> I have a lot of experience in the process of extracting profiles from large
													populations of galaxies. My work has been applied to first the SHELS-F2 field, and
													then COSMOS galaxies in both HSC (grizy) images, and CLAUDS (u,u*) images.
													I have refined the 1D profile extraction algorithm in Photutils to better
													handle masked pixels with minimal loss of computation efficiency, and to
													not immediately fail if a starting ellipse cannot be found. The extracted
													profiles are being used by students at Saint Mary's University to understand more
													about galaxy evolution at the population level. </p>

												<p>
													I have also worked on developing a simulation suite that quantifies
													the amount of "usable profile" from an extraction, based on deviations
													of observed profiles of galaxies generated with Sérsic profiles from
													their "true" profiles. More info can be found on my <a href="code.html"> Code </a>
													page.

											<p> Low-SB Merging Features </p>

												<p>
													Galaxies that have undergone mergers often have characteristic structural elements, in particular high-frequency
													features like streams or shells. Building a machine-learning program that can automatically detect these merging
													features is of great interest to anyone studying galaxy evolution.
												</p>
												<p>
													In 2019-2020 I worked with Ivana Damjanov, Ophélie Karishma Leste (now at
													the University of Victoria), and another undergraduate student to manually
													classify thousands of SDSS galaxies for the development of a detection algorithm,
													led by <a href="https://calderilla15.wixsite.com/helenadominguez">
													Helena Domínguez Sánchez</a>. This development is onging.
