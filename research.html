										<p>Hark! Hark! Triton. Hark! Bellow, bid our father the sea king. Rise from the
											depths full foul in his fury. Black waves teeming with salt foam to smother
											this young mouth with pungent slime. To choke ye. Engorging your
											organs till ye turn blue and bloated with bilge and brine and can scream no
											more. Only when he, crowned in cockle shells, with slithering tentacle tail,
											and steaming beard take up his fell befinned arm, his coral tongued trident
											screeches banshee-like in the tempest, and plunges right through your
											gullet. Bursting ye. A bulging bladder no more, but a blasted bloody film
											now a nothing for the harpies and the souls of dead sailors to pick and claw
											and feed upon only to be lapped up and swallowed up by the infinite waters
											of the dread emperor himself. Forgotten to any man, to any time. Forgotten
											to any god or devil,
											forgotten even to the sea. For any stuff or part of Winslow, even any
											scantling of your soul is Winslow no more, but is now itself the sea.</p>

										</header>
										<p>
											Galaxies that have undergone mergers often have characteristic structural elements, in particular high-frequency
											features like streams or shells. Building a machine-learning program that can automatically detect these merging
											features is of great interest to anyone studying galaxy evolution.
										</p>
										<p>
											In 2019-2020 I worked with Ivana Damjanov, Oph√©lie Karishma Leste, and another undergrduate student to manually
											classify thousands of these galaxies for the development of a detection algorithm, led by <a href="https://calderilla15.wixsite.com/helenadominguez">
											Helena Dominguez Sanchez</a>. This development is onging.
