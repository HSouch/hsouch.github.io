												<p> Surface brightness profiles quantify the light of a galaxy as a function of
													distance from its center. It has a vast multitide of uses, and a significant amount
													of information about a galaxy's properties and overall structure can be gleaned from
													even a simple 1-dimensional profile. </p>

												<p> I have a lot of experience in the process of extracting profiles from large
													populations of galaxies. My work has been applied to first the SHELS-F2 field, and
													then COSMOS galaxies in both HSC (grizy) images, and CLAUDS (u,u*) images.
													I have refined the 1D profile extraction algorithm in Photutils to better
													handle masked pixels with minimal loss of computation time, and to
													not immediately fail if a starting ellipse cannot be found. The extracted
													profiles are being used by students at Saint Mary's University to understand more
													about galaxy evolution at the population level. </p>

												<p>
													I have also worked on developing a simulation suite that quantifies
													the amount of "usable profile" from an extraction, based on deviations
													of observed profiles of galaxies generated with Sérsic profiles from
													their "true" profiles. More info can be found on my <a href="code.html"> Code </a>
													page.

												<p>
													Galaxies that have undergone mergers often have characteristic structural elements, in particular high-frequency
													features like streams or shells. Building a machine-learning program that can automatically detect these merging
													features is of great interest to anyone studying galaxy evolution.
												</p>
												<p>
													In 2019-2020 I worked with Ivana Damjanov, Ophélie Karishma Leste (now at
													the University of Victoria), and another undergraduate student to manually
													classify thousands of SDSS galaxies for the development of a detection algorithm,
													led by <a href="https://calderilla15.wixsite.com/helenadominguez">
													Helena Domínguez Sánchez</a>. This development is onging.
